# No Mans Sky Market Database

This is a companion app to track the trade goods of the systems that you have visited in No Mans Sky. All of the data is stored locally in your browser and no network connection is needed. I built the app soley for my own purposes and if you have any ideas to make it easier to use let me know!

You can add systems using the "Creator" on the right side of app and you can view the systems that you have already entered in the buy and sell columns. Percentages can be negative when entering the "Percent" value for an item in a system.

Here is the link to the Github hosted site if you would like to try it out: https://rileymccuen.github.io/NMSMarketDatabase/
